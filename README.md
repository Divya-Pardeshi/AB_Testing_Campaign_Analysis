# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

This project aims to compare the performance of Facebook and AdWords advertising campaigns in 2019 to determine which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By analyzing the data, we can help allocate resources efficiently and optimize advertising strategies for better outcomes.

## Business Problem

As a marketing agency, our primary objective is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for our clients' advertising campaigns. We have conducted two ad campaigns, one on Facebook and the other on AdWords, and need to determine which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By identifying the most effective platform, we can optimize our advertising strategies to deliver better outcomes for our clients.

## Research Question

Which ad platform is more effective in terms of conversions, clicks, and overall cost-effectiveness?

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of the 2019 marketing campaign data from Facebook and AdWords, the following conclusions were drawn:

- **Facebook Ads**: Facebook consistently outperformed AdWords in terms of both clicks and conversions, with a higher correlation between ad clicks and conversions. This suggests that Facebook's targeting and engagement mechanisms are more effective in driving conversions for the campaigns analyzed.
  
- **AdWords Ads**: While AdWords showed moderate effectiveness in generating clicks, the conversion rate was lower than Facebook, with a weaker relationship between clicks and conversions.

- **Recommendation**: Given the higher conversion rates and stronger correlation with clicks, we recommend reallocating the marketing budget towards Facebook advertising for future campaigns. However, it's important to continue monitoring the performance of both platforms, as the optimal strategy may vary depending on market conditions, product type, and campaign objectives.

Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of different ad platforms and can help optimize future advertising strategies to maximize return on investment (ROI).
